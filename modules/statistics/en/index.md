# Statistics (level 4)

> This module is a BETA version! It's quite big, new and there's no checkpy.

In this module we'll get to work on statistics. It's obvious that  the computer can be put to great use to extract all sorts of interesting information out of data. But could we also test hypotheses: do we, or don't we observe a correlation in our data?

In the video below, [DaniÃ«l Lakens](https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/industrial-engineering-innovation-sciences/the-department/staff/detail/ep/e/d/ep-uid/20091001/) is associate professor at the TU/e and tells about the combination of statistics and programming.
