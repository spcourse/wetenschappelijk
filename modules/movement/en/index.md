# Simulations

In physics a lot of research is done on problems that cannot be analytically, by hand, solved. Nevertheless there are a myriad of techniques that, often in a roundabout way, can generate solutions for these problems. In most cases such a technique is very laborious and always involve the aid of computers.

In this module we'll take a look at two techniques: *simulating* physical scenarios and *fitting* measured data.

When simulating you take small steps in time and calculate crudely what happened in between each step: for example the movement of an object. The trick that is only applicable with a computer, is to make those steps in time as small as possible, which makes the movement increasingly "fluid" as you calculate each step. Eventually a simulation describes almost exactly what would actually happen in reality. At least, if the simulation makes use of correct premises!

We start out with a problem that you yourself can verify the answers to with help of some high school physics, but afterwards you depend on your programming skills and physical intuition to devise a solution.
